# Stanza: A batteries-included toolbox for jax-based Machine Learning :rocket: :rocket: :rocket:

This repository currently concurrently serves as a monorepo for various of my
research projects (located as private git submodules in the projects/) directory.
However it can also be used independently. Eventually I'll get around to cleanly separating
stanza and the various projects once things are a bit more stable


## Installation

Stanza uses anaconda for the base environment management.
```bash
	poetry install
```
